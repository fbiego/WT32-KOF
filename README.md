# WT32-KOF

The King of Fighters game.

Modified the original code to run on WT32 SC01 Plus board.
This includes the ui and functions of the game. While the game requires two push buttons for each player the code has been modified to include onscreen controls for demo purposes.

The original code can be found on [Elecrow-RD/The-king-of-fighters-on-ESP32](https://github.com/Elecrow-RD/The-king-of-fighters-on-ESP32)

## Compiling

The code is a PlatformIO project. The easiest way to get started is opening the project folder in VS Code. The necessary VS Code extensions should be automatically downloaded.

This code has been compiled sucessfully using Espressif 32 Platform v6.3.2
